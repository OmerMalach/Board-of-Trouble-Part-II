# Multi-Agent Pathfinding implementation :running_man::running:

This repo serves as an implementation of a few Multi-Agent Pathfinding algorithms from scratch in Python using networkx, copy, numpy and tqdm.

## :point_down::point_down:*Algorithms Included*::point_down::point_down:

1. A* - from previous assignment ("A Board of Trouble Part 1")
2. Hill Climbing - local search
3. Simulated Annealing - stochastic global search 
4. K-beam - heuristic search
5. Genetic Algorithm - Evolutionary search


Assignment instructions can be found in ex2.pdf -> "A Board of Trouble Part 2"
